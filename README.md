 Project Log:

 Friday:
 - Decided on the project, a rhythm game inspired by the HACKS X theme
 - Worked on asset generation for a while, including note design and the title screen
 - Gave the title screen minor animations
 - made a prototype note generator

 Saturday:
 - Overhauled the note generator, focusing on syncing the timing of the notes with the music
 - Added more animations to both the level and the title screen
 - Added more assets and text
 - Added the scoring system (perfect, good, okay hits)
 - Created the development script for mapping the notes, which also referenced the beats of the song to align the notes
 - Resolved miscellaneous bugs such as multiple notes being able to be hit at once
 - Notes now appear in a queue and can only be hit if they are the foremost note in their row

Sunday:
- Small animations to the scorecard added
- Scoring bug fixed (missing lines of code were identified and added)
- Added API calls for random backgrounds for the level each time it is loaded
